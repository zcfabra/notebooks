    "# ### Observation Space\n",
    "# The state is an 8-dimensional vector: the coordinates of the lander in `x` & `y`, its linear\n",
    "# velocities in `x` & `y`, its angle, its angular velocity, and two booleans\n",
    "# that represent whether each leg is in contact with the ground or not.\n",

    "# sum of the rewards for all the steps within that episode.\n",

    "# - is increased/decreased the closer/further the lander is to the landing pad.\n",
